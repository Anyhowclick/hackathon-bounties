## What is Kyber?

Kyber is a fully on-chain protocol that powers decentralized token swaps for wallets, applications and platforms. It can be used in 4 major ways.

### 1. End User Token Swaps
The simplest use-case that allows users to easily swap from any ERC20 token to another, including Ether. This functionality can be found in popular wallets like MyEtherWallet and imToken, and on websites such as KyberSwap and Easwap.

### 2. Trading Integrations
We allow for arbitrage bots to take advantage and profit off market inefficiencies, either by directly interacting with our smart contracts, or through our recently announced [trading API](https://blog.kyber.network/introducing-the-kyber-trading-api-b30550645b74).

### 3. Payments
Users can purchase virtual collectibles in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with any supported ERC20 token on Kyber. More broadly, any platform can widen their payment options from just Ether to include ERC20 tokens as well. Examples include Hodlmoon and Chainfuel.

### 4. Finance
A number of financial DApps use Kyber as an on-chain price feed. The liquidity provided by Kyber’s reserves are also used for index fund rebalancing, as one can see in Betoken and Melonport.


## What has been built with Kyber?

### Instant token swaps
Embed simple and atomic ERC20 <-> ERC20 token swaps in your application. [Enjin](https://blog.kyber.network/enjin-wallet-integrates-kyber-to-enable-in-wallet-token-swaps-476a08f9bf9a) and [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/eth-knc) are examples of these.

### Single Step Payments
Expand your payment options for your users by accepting not just ETH, but ERC20 tokens too. Empower your users with the freedom of choice in pay in their favourite tokens. [Hodlmoon](https://blog.kyber.network/hodlmoon-to-integrate-kybers-woocommerce-plugin-and-accept-token-payments-6baeda65c10e) and [Chainfuel](https://www.chainfuel.com/blog/chainfuel-integrates-kyberwidget-to-accept-erc20-tokens-for-telegram-community-management-automation) are but some examples.

### On-chain Fund Rebalancing
Achieve seamless liquidation of assets for immediate rebalancing of portfolios in a single transaction. Take a look at [bZx](https://medium.com/@b0xNet/kyber-bzx-b6f5330289a6) and [Betoken](https://medium.com/betoken/6-primordial-reasons-to-build-a-decentralized-hedge-fund-with-kyber-1bbb3ed6a4d9) for a glimpse of what is possible!

### Arbitrage Programs

Take advantage of market inefficiencies, since prices are not always the same across different price discovery venues, especially between off-chain and on-chain prices. Help improve price equilibrium across the market whilst profiting from it!

Here's the entire ecosystem map on what has been built on top of the Kyber protocol.

## Bounties

Here's what we're looking to be built in ETHIndia. Total prize pool of $2550 up for grabs!

### [Open Bounty](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/21)
Build a DApp that utilises Kyber natively for token swaps, payments, liquidity, or DeFi! The integration could be done via a smart contract, Web3 libraries or API.

Prize Pool: $150 USD x 5 teams

### [Permissionless Liquidity Contribution](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/22)
Create a new reserve that allows anyone to easily contribute liquidity to through an intuitive UI, without the need for KYC.

Prize Pool: $600 USD x 2 teams

### [Modifying KyberWidget](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/23)
The KyberWidget currently interacts directly with the KyberNetworkProxy contract only. It would be great if it could interact with wrapper contracts as well, by allowing the developer to configure the wrapper contract address and smart contract function to be called, and to be easily embedded into websites.

Prize Pool: $300 USD x 2 teams


## Judging Criteria
### 1. Idea
The importance of Kyber's protocol in the application, & originality of the idea.

### 2. User Experience
Intuitive, easy to use and interact with.

### 3. Technical Difficulty
Going above and beyond of what we specified. Good code quality, bug free, with thorough documentation.

### 4. Usability
Other projects are able to build on top of your application, or incorporate it into their own.

### 5. X Factor
Something that makes us go "Wow!"


## Terms and Conditions

The prize amount to be awarded to each team is at the judges’ discretion. Should the project fail to meet satisfactory levels, a partial reward may be given instead of the full amount.
