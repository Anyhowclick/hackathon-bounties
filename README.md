## What is Kyber?
Kyber is a fully on-chain protocol that powers decentralised token swaps for wallets, applications and platforms. It can be used in 4 major ways.

### 1. End User Token Swaps
The simplest use-case that allows users to easily swap from any ERC20 token to another, including Ether. This functionality can be found in popular wallets like MyEtherWallet and imToken, and on websites such as KyberSwap and Easwap.

### 2. Trading Integrations
We allow for arbitrage bots to take advantage and profit off market inefficiencies, either by directly interacting with our smart contracts, or through our recently announced [trading API](https://blog.kyber.network/introducing-the-kyber-trading-api-b30550645b74).

### 3. Payments
Users can purchase virtual collectibles in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with any supported ERC20 token on Kyber. More broadly, any platform can widen their payment options from just Ether to include ERC20 tokens as well. Examples include Hodlmoon and Chainfuel.

### 4. Finance
A number of financial DApps use Kyber as an on-chain price feed. The liquidity provided by Kyberâ€™s reserves are also used for index fund rebalancing, as one can see in Betoken and MelonPort.


## What can you #BUIDLwithKyber?

### Instant token swaps
Embed simple and atomic ERC20 <-> ERC20 token swaps in your application. [Enjin](https://blog.kyber.network/enjin-wallet-integrates-kyber-to-enable-in-wallet-token-swaps-476a08f9bf9a) and [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/eth-knc) are examples of these.

### Single Step Payments
Expand your payment options for your users by accepting not just ETH, but ERC20 tokens too. Empower your users with the freedom of choice in pay in their favourite tokens. [Hodlmoon](https://blog.kyber.network/hodlmoon-to-integrate-kybers-woocommerce-plugin-and-accept-token-payments-6baeda65c10e) and [Chainfuel](https://www.chainfuel.com/blog/chainfuel-integrates-kyberwidget-to-accept-erc20-tokens-for-telegram-community-management-automation) are but some examples.

### On-chain Fund Rebalancing
Achieve seamless liquidation of assets for immediate rebalancing of portfolios in a single transaction. Take a look at [bZx](https://medium.com/@b0xNet/kyber-bzx-b6f5330289a6) and [Betoken](https://medium.com/betoken/6-primordial-reasons-to-build-a-decentralized-hedge-fund-with-kyber-1bbb3ed6a4d9) for a glimpse of what is possible!

### Arbitrage Programs
Take advantage of market inefficiencies, since prices are not always the same across different price discovery venues, especially between off-chain and on-chain prices. Help improve price equilibrium across the market whilst profiting from it!

If you need more ideas on what you can build, take a look at the bounties below!

## Bounties
### [Integrate Kyber into an application that takes advantage a scaling solution](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/15)
Build a DApp that utilises one of the scaling solutions and integrate Kyber's protocol to handle the payment layer!

## Prizes
Stand to win up to $1500 USD worth of KNC tokens for Kyber's EDCON bounty.

## Judging Criteria
### 1. Idea
The importance of Kyber's protocol in the application, & originality of the idea.

### 2. User Experience
